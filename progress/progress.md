# **Drone Project: Phases & Progress**

> *Building the future of autonomous flight, one phase at a time.*

---

## **Project Overview**

This project is dedicated to developing a drone with **progressive autonomy**—from manual control to advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance.

---

## **Phase 1: Manual Flight Control**

- **Objective:**  
    Achieve stable manual flight using an RC transmitter and Pixhawk-based hardware.

- **Status:**  
    <span style="color:green;">**Completed**</span>

- **Details:**
    - Multiple successful test flights.
    - Calibrated ESCs, correctly oriented propellers.
    - Robust Pixhawk flight controller setup.

- **Highlight:**  
    Invited to showcase at the **1 Air Squadron NCC Drone Training Camp, Kullu**—a testament to the phase's success!

## **Phase 2: Autonomous GPS Waypoint Navigation**

- **Objective:**  
    Enable autonomous flight via Mission Planner, GPS, and waypoints.

- **Status:**  
    <span style="color:orange;">**In Progress**</span>

- **Progress:**
    - Initial setup complete.
    - One test flight attempted (pending telemetry & GPS fine-tuning).

- **Next Steps:**
    1. Install & configure GPS + telemetry module.
    2. Plan/upload waypoints in Mission Planner.
    3. Conduct real-time autonomous flight tests.

## **Phase 3: Obstacle Avoidance**

- **Objective:**  
    Implement real-time object detection and avoidance.

- **Status:**  
    <span style="color:red;">**Not Started**</span>

- **Planned Features:**
    - Integrate ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors.
    - Onboard processing (Arduino/Raspberry Pi/companion computer).
    - Program logic for autonomous obstacle avoidance.

---

## **Roadmap**

1. Complete GPS & telemetry integration
2. Achieve reliable autonomous waypoint navigation
3. Develop & test obstacle avoidance algorithms
4. Iterate and improve based on test results

---

## **Achievements**

- Successful manual flight & demonstration at a national drone training camp.
